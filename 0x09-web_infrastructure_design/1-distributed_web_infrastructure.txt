Specifics:

Load Balancer (HAproxy): Introducing a load balancer helps distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving performance and reliability.
Distribution Algorithm: Round Robin algorithm is used.  Each server is used in turn, distributing requests equally.
Setup: Active-Active setup is employed here. All servers actively handle requests.
Servers (2): Two servers were added because servers increase system reliability, and they can handle a larger volume of traffic.
Web Server (Nginx): It was added because, Nginx serves as the web server, handling HTTP requests and directing them to the application server.
How a Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster Works: A primary-replica (master-slave) cluster is a type of database architecture that consists of two nodes: a primary node and a replica node. The primary node handles all write operations, and the replica node mirrors the data from the primary node.
Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes in Relation to the Application:
Primary Node: Accepts write operations, which make changes to the database.
Replica Node: Mirrors data from the primary node and is used for read operations. It does not handle write operations directly.
 
Issues:
SPOF: The load balancer is a potential single point of failure. If it fails, all incoming traffic is disrupted.
Security issues:
No firewall exposes the servers and database to potential threats.
Not enforcing HTTPS leaves user data vulnerable during transmission.
The absence of monitoring tools makes it difficult to detect and address issues quickly.
