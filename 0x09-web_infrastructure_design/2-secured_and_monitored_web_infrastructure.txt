ALX 0x09. Web infrastructure design
Task 2

Explanations:
Why additional elements were added: Adding firewalls enhances security, SSL certificates
encrypt data for safe transmission, and monitoring clients ensure continuous visibility,
collectively safeguarding my web infrastructure from unauthorized access, data breaches, and performance issues.

What are firewalls for: Firewalls are needed in a web infrastructure to act as a
protective barrier, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic.
They help prevent unauthorized access, secure sensitive data, and mitigate potential
cyber threats, enhancing the overall security of the web infrastructure.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS: Serving traffic over HTTPS in a web infrastructure
is essential for security. 

HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the user's browser and the server, protecting
it from interception or tampering by malicious actors. This encryption ensures the
confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information,
such as login credentials and personal data, enhancing overall user privacy and trust.

What monitoring is used for: Server monitoring in a web infrastructure is used to observe
and track the performance, health, and availability of servers. It helps identify issues,
such as high resource usage or potential failures, in real time. Monitoring ensures proactive
management, timely problem resolution, and optimal performance, enhancing the reliability and 
efficiency of the web infrastructure.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data: It observes and records key metrics like query performance, 
database connections, and server resource usage, providing real-time insights into the health and 
efficiency of the Application server, Nginx web server and MySQL database.

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS: To monitor my web server QPS (Queries 
Per Second), I would use a monitoring tool that tracks the incoming requests and server responses, 
providing real-time data on the rate at which queries are processed.

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue: Terminating SSL at the load balancer level 
can be an issue because it means that the encrypted connection is decrypted at the load balancer, 
potentially exposing sensitive data during the internal communication between the load balancer and the 
other servers in the infrastructure.

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue: Having only one MySQL server 
capable of accepting writes is an issue because it creates a single point of failure â€” if this server 
goes down or experiences issues, the entire application's ability to write data to the database is 
compromised, leading to potential data loss and service interruptions.

Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be 
a problem: This can be a problem because it lacks redundancy and diversity, making the entire system 
vulnerable to a single point of failure; if a particular component fails, it affects all servers 
simultaneously, compromising the overall reliability and availability of the infrastructure.
