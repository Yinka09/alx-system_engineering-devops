ALX 0x09. Web infrastructure design
Task 3

Explanations:
Why additional elements were added: Splitting components (web server, application server, database) 
onto their own servers adds redundancy, improves scalability, and enhances security by isolating 
functions. If one component fails, it doesn't impact the others, allowing for more efficient resource 
allocation, easier maintenance, and better overall performance of your web infrastructure.

Firewalls were added to each component to enhance security by controlling and monitoring incoming and 
outgoing traffic on each server, protecting against unauthorised access and potential threats. 

Monitoring tools were also added on each server to provide real-time insights into performance, help 
identify issues promptly, optimise resource usage, and ensure the overall health and reliability of the 
server infrastructure.

Adding an extra load balancer configured as a cluster with the existing one improves the overall 
reliability and availability of the system. It ensures load balancing continuity, even if one load 
balancer fails, by seamlessly distributing incoming traffic between servers. This redundancy enhances 
fault tolerance, minimises downtime, and optimises the performance of the web infrastructure.
